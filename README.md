Create a database table `Person` to collect information about a series of People.

People can be added, edited and deleted from the database using the web app. The main page displays all People currently in the database, with the attributes `name`, `size`, `height`, `fame` and `income` visually represented. A detailed list of attributes for a particular Person can be viewed by clicking on their name on the main page.
